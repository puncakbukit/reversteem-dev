# Reversteem – Reversi on Steem

A fully client-side, deterministic Reversi (Othello) game built on top of the **Steem** blockchain.

Reversteem demonstrates how a complete turn-based multiplayer game can run using only posts and replies as an immutable event log — without smart contracts and without any backend server.

This project is both a playable game and a protocol experiment.

# 🏗 Architecture

Reversteem is fully decentralized.

There is:

* No backend
* No server authority
* No centralized state
* No off-chain game storage

Everything is derived from the Steem blockchain.

The blockchain acts as a deterministic event log.

All game state, ratings, timers, and outcomes are computed locally by replaying immutable history.

---

## 📁 File Structure

The application is split into four focused files loaded in order:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Minimal HTML shell — CDN script tags, global CSS, `<div id="app">` mount point |
| `engine.js` | Pure game logic — board replay, ELO calculation, tag generation, move transcript, permlink conversion, utility functions. No Vue, no DOM, no blockchain dependencies |
| `blockchain.js` | All Steem API interactions — RPC fallback, account fetching, reply traversal, Keychain posting |
| `components.js` | Reusable Vue 3 components — Board, PlayerBar, SpectatorConsole, MoveTranscript, MiniBoard, GamePreview, GameFilter, Auth controls |
| `app.js` | Vue Router setup, route views (Dashboard / Game / Profile / Leaderboard / About), root `App` component, mount |

This separation keeps the game engine independently testable and the blockchain layer independently swappable.

---

## 🖼 Frontend Framework

Reversteem uses **Vue 3** and **Vue Router 4**, loaded via CDN — no build step required.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue-router@4/dist/vue-router.global.js"></script>
```

The application uses the **Options API** for route view components and the **Composition API** (`setup()`) for the root `App` component.

All components are registered globally on the Vue app instance and use in-template string templates (no `.vue` single-file components, no bundler required).

---

## 🗺 Routing

Vue Router 4 uses **hash history** (`createWebHashHistory`), making it compatible with static hosting on GitHub Pages without server-side redirect configuration.

| Route | View | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `#/` | `DashboardView` | Open games list with featured game board preview |
| `#/game/:author/:permlink` | `GameView` | Live game board, polling, spectator chat, move transcript |
| `#/@:user` | `ProfileView` | All games posted by a specific user |
| `#/leaderboard` | `LeaderboardView` | ELO rankings across all rated players |
| `#/about` | `AboutView` | Project documentation |

`username` and `hasKeychain` are passed into each route view via Vue `provide` / `inject`.

---

## 🧩 Vue Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ProfileHeaderComponent` | Displays the logged-in user's cover image, avatar, display name, and ELO rating. Falls back to the `@reversteem` account's cover and avatar for guests |
| `AuthControlsComponent` | Login form (shown on all pages via nav Login link), time preset selector, timeout input (min 1), game title input, invite inputs, Start Game button |
| `BoardComponent` | Renders the 8×8 game board reactively; emits `cell-click`; disables interaction while a move is submitting |
| `PlayerBarComponent` | Displays both players' avatars and ELO ratings; highlights the active player with a gold glow |
| `SpectatorConsoleComponent` | Terminal-style chat panel; shows spectator comments anchored to move coordinates |
| `MoveTranscriptComponent` | Terminal-style panel displayed below the spectator console; shows a chronological table of all moves (number, color, square, time) |
| `MiniBoardComponent` | Compact 20px-per-cell board used in featured game previews |
| `OthelloTableComponent` | Static marble table image thumbnail used for non-featured game cards |
| `GamePreviewComponent` | Game card used in Dashboard and Profile views; fetches preview state once on mount |
| `GameFilterComponent` | Inline filter bar for Dashboard and Profile views; filters by timeout preset or custom operator and by ELO operator |

### Guest Profile Header

When no user is logged in, `ProfileHeaderComponent` automatically fetches the `@reversteem` account and displays its cover image and avatar instead of leaving the header blank. The ELO badge is hidden in guest mode. The fallback is loaded lazily and only fetched once per session.

### Flicker-Free Polling

`GameView` polls the blockchain every **15 seconds**. To prevent visible page jumps on each poll:

* `PlayerBarComponent` accepts pre-resolved `blackData` / `whiteData` account objects as props — it never fetches accounts itself. The parent (`GameView`) fetches account data once and only re-fetches if a player username changes (e.g., white player just joined).
* On re-polls, `GameView` **merges** updated fields into the existing `gameState` object rather than replacing it entirely. This allows Vue to diff at the field level — unchanged data (player names, timeout settings) never triggers child re-renders.
* `loading` is only `true` on the very first load. Subsequent polls update state silently without unmounting the board.
* `SpectatorConsoleComponent` only auto-scrolls to the bottom when the message count actually increases, preventing jarring scroll jumps while the user is reading.

---

## 🔐 Login / Logout

Login and logout are controlled via links in the navigation menu:

* **Login** link appears at the end of the nav when no user is logged in. Clicking it toggles an inline login form (username input + Sign in / Cancel buttons) that is visible on **all pages** — not only the homepage. Clicking Login again or pressing Escape collapses the form.
* **Logout** link replaces Login once the user is authenticated. Clicking it immediately logs out and hides the form if open.

The login form is part of `AuthControlsComponent` but its visibility is controlled by the `showLoginForm` ref in the root `App`, passed down as a prop. This keeps the form accessible globally while the game creation controls remain restricted to the home and profile pages.

---

# 🔗 On-Chain Game Model

| Blockchain Object | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Root Post | Represents a game (Black player is the author) |
| Join Comment | Registers the White player |
| Move Comment | Represents one move |
| Timeout Claim | Claims victory after the opponent exceeds their time limit |
| Comment Order | Defines deterministic replay order (chronological by `created`) |

Only comments containing valid JSON metadata for the `reversteem/x.y` app are processed as game events.

All other comments (including spectator chat) are classified separately and displayed in the spectator console without affecting game state.

---

# 🔖 Game Permlinks

When a game is created, its root post permlink is generated from the game title:

```
convertToPermlink(title) + "-" + Date.now()
```

`convertToPermlink` performs the following transforms in order:

1. Lowercase the title
2. Trim leading/trailing whitespace
3. Replace whitespace runs with hyphens
4. Strip any characters not in `[a-z0-9-]` (Steem permlink alphabet)
5. Collapse consecutive hyphens
6. Trim leading/trailing hyphens
7. Truncate the slug to **241 characters** (leaving 14 characters for the `-` + 13-digit timestamp, staying within Steem's 255-character permlink limit)

This produces human-readable, URL-safe permlinks such as:

```
standard-reversteem-game-by-an-elo-1200-player-1747123456789
```

---

# 🏷 Automatic Game Tagging

When a game is created, Reversteem automatically builds and attaches up to 7 Steem tags (the maximum supported alongside the required `reversteem` parent tag) derived from the game parameters.

## Tag Format

| Position | Tag | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Time control preset name, or `mins-[N]` for custom values | `blitz`, `rapid`, `standard`, `daily`, `mins-30` |
| 2 | Black player's raw ELO rating | `elo-1184` |
| 3 | `reversi` | `reversi` |
| 4 | `othello` | `othello` |
| 5 | `board` | `board` |
| 6 | `game` | `game` |
| 7 | `steem` | `steem` |

Tags are generated by `buildGameTags(timeoutMinutes, username)` in `engine.js` and merged into the post's `json_metadata.tags` array before submission. Steem Keychain's `requestPost` reads tags from `json_metadata` — there is no separate tags argument.

---

# 📝 `boardToMarkdown` – Native Steemit Compatibility

Steemit's default interface does not execute JavaScript.

Reversteem includes a `boardToMarkdown(board)` function in `engine.js` to render a visual board snapshot using a Markdown table with emoji pieces (⚫ / ⚪ / ·).

The board includes both **column labels** (A–H in the header row) and **row labels** (1–8 in the first column of each data row), making it easy to read move coordinates directly from the Steemit interface.

Example header:

```
|   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | · | · | ...
```

This is embedded in every move comment body, allowing:

* Spectators on Steemit to view the board position after each move
* Non-dApp users to follow the game
* Protocol transparency to remain intact outside the dApp

---

# 📋 Move Transcript

Every move reply comment includes a **move transcript** table below the board, listing all moves made in the game up to and including the current one.

The transcript is generated by `movesToTranscript(moves, blackPlayer, whitePlayer)` in `engine.js` and rendered as a Markdown table with columns:

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| `#` | Move number |
| `Color` | ⚫ Black or ⚪ White |
| `Square` | Board coordinate (e.g. `D3`) |
| `Time` | UTC timestamp of the move |

The same transcript is displayed **in-game** via `MoveTranscriptComponent`, rendered as a terminal-style table below the spectator console. It updates live with each poll cycle.

---

# ⏳ Time Limit System

Reversteem supports deterministic per-move time limits.

## Game Creation Metadata

```json
{
  "app": "reversteem/0.1",
  "type": "game_start",
  "black": "username",
  "white": null,
  "timeoutMinutes": 60,
  "tags": ["standard", "elo-1200", "reversi", "othello", "board", "game", "steem"]
}
```

### `timeoutMinutes`

* Defines the maximum time per move
* Minimum enforced: **1 minute** (aligned with Steem's ~3 second block time)
* Maximum enforced: **10,080 minutes (7 days)**
* Default: **60 minutes (1 hour)**

Timeout is inactive until both players have joined.

---

## 🕒 Timeout Mechanics (Claimable Model)

Timeout is derived from blockchain timestamps.

For each move:

1. Determine the timestamp of the last valid move (or game start time if no moves yet)
2. Determine whose turn it is
3. Compare:

```
currentTime - lastMoveTime >= timeoutMinutes
```

If true:

* The current player has exceeded their time limit
* The opponent may post a `timeout_claim` comment

---

## 🏆 Timeout Claim Metadata

```json
{
  "app": "reversteem/0.1",
  "action": "timeout_claim",
  "claimAgainst": "black",
  "moveNumber": 12
}
```

Replay validation requires:

* Game not already finished
* Both players joined
* Timeout threshold exceeded (`minutesPassed >= timeoutMinutes`)
* `moveNumber` matches `appliedMoves` at time of claim
* `claimAgainst` matches the color of the player whose turn it is
* Claim author matches the expected winner (the opponent of the timed-out player)

If valid:

* Game ends immediately
* Winner is set deterministically
* Further moves are ignored

---

## ⚖ Timeout Edge Case Behavior

Once the timeout threshold is exceeded:

* Only a valid `timeout_claim` is accepted
* Further moves by the timed-out player are rejected deterministically during replay

This prevents race-condition ambiguity between a late move and a timeout claim.

Timeout enforcement is derived during replay — not triggered by UI.

---

# 🎮 Time Control Presets

When creating a game, users can select:

| Mode | Minutes per move |
|---|---|
| Blitz | 1 |
| Rapid | 5 |
| Standard | 60 (default) |
| Daily | 1440 |

Users may also enter a custom value (minimum 1 minute, maximum 10,080 minutes).

Presets are UI helpers only — replay enforces the actual `timeoutMinutes` value stored in the root post metadata.

---

# 🔍 Game Filtering

The Dashboard and Profile views include a `GameFilterComponent` that lets visitors narrow the game list without reloading from the blockchain.

## Timeout Filter

* **Preset buttons**: tap Blitz, Rapid, Standard, or Daily to filter to that exact timeout value
* **Custom operator**: use `<`, `=`, or `>` with a manually entered minute value for non-preset timeouts
* Preset and custom modes are mutually exclusive

## ELO Filter

* Use `<`, `=`, or `>` with a rating value to filter games by the Black player's current ELO

A **✕ Clear** button appears whenever any filter is active.

Filtering is purely client-side — it operates on the already-loaded game list and adds no additional blockchain requests. The `timeoutMinutes` field is extracted from each game's `json_metadata` during enrichment in `deriveWhitePlayer`, making it available without loading the full game state.

---

# 🏆 ELO Rating System

Reversteem includes a fully deterministic, client-derived ELO rating system.

There is:

* No on-chain rating storage
* No backend leaderboard database
* No rating authority

Ratings are computed locally from finished games and cached in `localStorage` under the key `reversteem_elo_cache`.

---

## 📊 Rating Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Base rating | 1200 |
| K-factor | 32 |

## Rating Formula

For each completed game:

```
R' = R + K × (S - E)
E  = 1 / (1 + 10^((R_opponent - R) / 400))
```

Where `S` = 1 (win), 0 (loss), or 0.5 (draw). Timeout wins count as normal wins.

---

## 🔄 Deterministic Reconstruction

Ratings are reconstructed by:

1. Collecting finished games
2. Sorting chronologically by `created`
3. Replaying outcomes in order
4. Applying ELO updates incrementally

The ELO cache is incremental — only games newer than `lastProcessed` are computed on subsequent loads.

Because outcomes are deterministic, ratings are deterministic. Any client replaying the same history computes identical ratings.

---

## 📈 Leaderboard

The **Leaderboard** page (`#/leaderboard`) displays all rated players sorted by ELO rating descending.

* Accessible from the navigation menu at all times (no login required)
* On load, fetches recent games from the `reversteem` tag to refresh the local ELO cache before rendering
* Top three players are shown with 🥇 🥈 🥉 medals
* Ratings are colour-coded: red (≥ 1400), orange (≥ 1300), green (≥ 1200), grey (below baseline)
* Game creation controls and the Spectator Mode notice are hidden on the Leaderboard page

---

# 🔢 Move Validation Rules

During deterministic replay:

* `moveNumber` must equal `appliedMoves` (sequential, no gaps or duplicates)
* Author must match the expected player for the current turn color
* Board index must be in range `0–63`
* Move must flip at least one opponent piece
* Turn must be correct (respecting automatic pass logic)
* No moves accepted after game end
* Moves are rejected once a valid timeout threshold has been exceeded

Invalid moves are silently skipped. Replay is deterministic, tamper-resistant, order-safe, and race-condition safe.

---

# 🔄 Automatic Pass Rule

If a player has no valid moves:

* Turn automatically passes to the opponent
* If both players have no valid moves → game ends immediately

Pass logic is enforced during replay. No manual pass transaction is required or supported.

---

# 🏁 End-of-Game Conditions

A game is finished when:

1. Both players have no valid moves remaining
2. A valid `timeout_claim` is applied during replay

When finished:

* `currentPlayer` becomes `null`
* Further moves are ignored
* Winner is determined by disc count, or set to the timeout claimant's opponent
* Board becomes frozen in the UI

---

# 🛑 Double-Submission Prevention

All Keychain actions are guarded against double-submission:

| Action | Guard mechanism |
|---|---|
| Start New Game | `isStartingGame` ref in root `App`; Start Game button disabled while pending |
| Join Game (game page) | `isSubmitting` flag in `GameView`; Join button disabled while pending |
| Join Game (dashboard / profile) | `isJoining` dictionary keyed by permlink; each game card tracked independently |
| Post Move | `isSubmitting` flag in `GameView`; board disabled while pending |
| Claim Timeout | `isSubmitting` flag in `GameView`; Claim button disabled while pending |
| Post Comment | `isSubmitting` flag in `GameView`; send action blocked while pending |

All guards reset on both success and failure callback paths so the UI never locks permanently if Keychain rejects a request.

---

# ⚡ Replay Caching

To reduce redundant blockchain fetches:

* Derived game state is cached in `localStorage` per game, keyed by `author + permlink`
* Cache is considered valid if the latest reply `created` timestamp and total reply count both match
* Cache is invalidated automatically when new replies arrive

Cache is an optimization only — never a source of truth. Full replay remains authoritative.

---

# 🌐 Multi-RPC Fallback

Reversteem automatically rotates between public RPC nodes if a request fails:

```
https://api.steemit.com
https://api.justyy.com
https://steemd.steemworld.org
https://api.steem.fans
```

The fallback logic lives in `callWithFallback` / `callWithFallbackAsync` in `blockchain.js`. On failure, it increments `currentRPCIndex` and retries transparently. No backend proxy required.

---

# 🔐 Security Model

Reversteem enforces:

* Strict metadata filtering (`app` field must start with `reversteem/`)
* Move sequence validation (`moveNumber` must equal `appliedMoves`)
* Turn validation (author must match expected player)
* Legal flip validation (at least one piece must be flipped)
* Automatic pass logic
* Deterministic timeout enforcement
* Claimable timeout validation (`claimAgainst`, `moveNumber`, and elapsed time all verified)
* End-state freeze (no moves after game end)
* Deterministic ELO reconstruction
* Replay cache validation (invalidated on reply count or timestamp change)
* RPC failover resilience
* Double-submission prevention on all Keychain actions (UI lock + `moveNumber` replay guard)
* Invite list enforcement (UI + replay)

Because state is derived from immutable history:

Malicious clients cannot forge outcomes.
Malicious users cannot manipulate ratings.
Every spectator independently verifies the game.

---

# 🎯 Design Philosophy

Reversteem demonstrates:

* Turn-based games do not require smart contracts
* Comment trees can function as deterministic event logs
* Ratings can be derived without on-chain storage
* Time control can be enforced without authority
* Fully frontend-only dApps are viable on static hosting
* Consensus logic can live entirely in the browser
* A modern reactive UI framework (Vue 3) can be adopted with zero build tooling

Reversteem is not merely a game.

It is a deterministic state machine embedded in a social blockchain.
